## 9. Methodology & Assumptions

This financial model is based on the following key assumptions and methodologies:

1. **User Growth**: Initial user growth is projected at 15% month-over-month in Year 1, accelerating to 20% in Year 2 as marketing efforts scale, then normalizing to 15% in Year 3.

2. **Conversion Rates**: The model assumes a gradual increase in conversion from freemium to paid tiers as the product matures and delivers more value to users.

3. **Ticket Sales**: Commission projections are based on modest initial ticket sales (5,000 in Year 1) with significant growth as the user base expands and as event organizers join the platform.

4. **Costs**: Development costs are front-loaded with significant initial investment for MVP, while marketing costs scale proportionally with user acquisition targets.

5. **Pricing Strategy**: The subscription pricing is positioned to be competitive with other entertainment and lifestyle apps while reflecting the premium value proposition of Momento.

6. **Market Penetration**: The model assumes initial focus on Paris, with expansion to other French cities in Year 2 and preparation for international expansion in Year 3.

7. **Seasonality**: Event attendance has natural seasonality that is factored into monthly revenue projections, with peaks in summer months and December.

## 10. Recommendations

Based on this financial model, we recommend:

1. **Funding Strategy**: Secure the initial pre-seed round of €750,000 to fund development and early operations, with preparations for a Series A round of €2,000,000 toward the end of Year 1.

2. **Growth Focus**: Prioritize user acquisition and retention over immediate monetization in the first 12-18 months to build a robust user base.

3. **Partnerships**: Aggressively pursue partnerships with key event organizers in Paris to ensure a strong supply of desirable events on the platform.

4. **Feature Prioritization**: Focus development resources on features that directly impact conversion rates and retention, particularly the calendar integration and recommendation algorithm.

5. **Pricing Optimization**: Conduct regular price sensitivity testing to optimize the premium tier pricing structure as the user base grows.

6. **Cost Control**: Maintain vigilant cost control, particularly in non-growth driving operational expenses, to extend runway and improve cash flow projections.

7. **Metrics Tracking**: Implement robust analytics from day one to track KPIs and enable data-driven refinement of the model assumptions.
