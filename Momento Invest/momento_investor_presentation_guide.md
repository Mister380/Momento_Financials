## Addressing Common Investor Questions

Prepare concise, data-driven answers to these common questions:

### 1. "Why will users pay for this when there are free alternatives?"
- Reference point: "Our research shows that 15% of cultural event attendees are willing to pay for a service that saves them time and improves discovery."
- Data: "In comparable lifestyle apps, conversion rates to paid tiers average 8-12% when clear value is demonstrated."
- Feature value: "Our calendar integration and AI recommendation engine provide unique value that isn't available in free alternatives."

### 2. "How will you acquire users cost-effectively?"
- Channels: "We've identified specific digital channels with CAC under €8, which is sustainable given our CLV of €15 in Year 1, improving to €32 by Year 3."
- Strategy: "Our growth strategy prioritizes word-of-mouth and referrals, with 20% of new users expected to come through these zero/low-cost channels by Month 6."
- Partnerships: "We've secured initial partnerships with 5 major cultural venues in Paris who will promote the app to their audiences."

### 3. "Why will event organizers use your platform?"
- Value prop: "Organizers gain access to a targeted audience of cultural enthusiasts with disposable income."
- Commission justification: "Our 7% commission is lower than industry averages (10-15%) and delivers qualified, high-intent customers."
- Data: "Early conversations with 15 event organizers show strong interest, with 8 committed to joining at launch."

### 4. "How confident are you in these projections?"
- Base case: "Our base case represents moderate growth based on comparable apps and market research."
- Testing: "We've stress-tested the model with conservative assumptions, showing sustainability even with 30% lower user growth."
- Validation: "Key assumptions have been validated through market research, industry benchmarks, and early user testing."

### 5. "What happens if growth is slower than expected?"
- Runway: "Our funding request includes a 15% buffer to extend runway if growth is slower."
- Levers: "We have identified specific levers to optimize unit economics, including reducing CAC and adjusting pricing."
- Milestones: "Our funding is tied to clear milestones, allowing us to adjust strategies based on actual performance data."

### 6. "When will you reach profitability?"
- Monthly: "We project monthly break-even in Month 32 (Year 3)."
- Variables: "This can be accelerated by 4-8 months through optimizing conversion rates and CAC."
- Long-term: "The model shows strong profitability potential once at scale, with projected 35% gross margins by Year 4."

## Presentation Tips

### Do's
- **Focus on unit economics**: Emphasize how the business works at the individual user level
- **Be transparent about assumptions**: Share the logic behind key projections
- **Use industry benchmarks**: Reference comparable companies to validate assumptions
- **Show multiple scenarios**: Demonstrate you've considered various outcomes
- **Connect financials to product milestones**: Show how funding drives specific progress
- **Know your metrics cold**: Be fluent with CAC, CLV, ARPU, MRR and other key metrics

### Don'ts
- **Don't overwhelm with details**: Focus on key drivers, not every line item

## Conclusion

The financial model is more than a set of projections—it's a strategic tool that communicates how Momento will grow and succeed. When presented effectively, it demonstrates your team's business acumen, understanding of the market, and realistic approach to building a sustainable company.

Remember that investors fund teams first, ideas second, and projections third. The financial model should support your overall story rather than being the focus itself. Show that you understand the business from all angles, and that the financial projections are an output of that understanding.
